# Introduction

## What is this?

Domino Low Code Assistant™ (LCA) accelerates common routines in Jupyter notebook with a GUI assistant (such as importing data, data munging, and creating/editing charts). Every interaction with the LCA generates the underlying Python code that is being executed, helping beginning practitioners to learn and edit essential Python data science code.
